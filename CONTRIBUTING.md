# Contributing to Hermes Mobile

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Hermes Mobile! To maintain high code quality and consistency, we ask all contributors to follow the workflow and guidelines outlined below.

## PR Workflow

All code changes must go through a pull request (PR). Directly pushing to `main` is not allowed.

1. **Pick or open an issue** to discuss the changes you want to make.
2. **Create a branch** off `main` using the following naming convention:
   - Features: `feat/issue-N-description`
   - Bug fixes: `fix/issue-N-description`
3. **Implement your changes** and format them locally.
4. **Submit a PR** targeting the `main` branch.
5. **Ensure all CI checks pass** (formatting, linting, and unit tests).
6. **Maintainers will squash-merge** your PR into `main`.

## Code Style

We enforce Kotlin coding conventions and Jetpack Compose best practices.

### Kotlin Formatting
- Code formatting is checked and enforced by **ktlint 1.2.1**.
- Run formatting check locally before committing:
  ```bash
  ./ktlint <file>            # Check one file
  ./ktlint --format <file>   # Auto-fix formatting issues
  ```
- Import ordering is strictly ASCII-lexicographic (uppercase before lowercase: e.g., `LaunchedEffect` before `collectAsState`).

### Compose Guidelines
- Standard screen structures must use `HermesScaffold` rather than raw Material3 `Scaffold`.
- Composable parameters must follow the standard order: `modifier` first, then event callbacks, and finally children content.
